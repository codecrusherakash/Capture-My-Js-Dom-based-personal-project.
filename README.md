>Capture, Reimagining Interactions Without Images
Capture is not a clone. It's a conceptual exploration â€” what if we could build engaging, scroll-worthy UI interactions by using a few images. 
<br>Built With:<br>
HTML5<br>
CSS3<br>
JavaScript DOM<br>
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)<br>
Key Features:<br>
Instagram-style like button powered by event listeners & DOM updates<br>
Side Bars animated using GSAP<br>
The Challenge:<br>
How do you evoke emotion or interaction with just few visuals?<br>
My answer: DOM logic + animation = pure frontend storytelling.<br>
What I Learned:<br>
Deep dive into DOM events & manipulation<br>
Timing based animation with GSAP<br>
UX creation from minimal design inputs<br>
Vision:<br>
This mini project was a step to not just build, but to create feeling in the browser using code even if it's small, it's meaningful.
